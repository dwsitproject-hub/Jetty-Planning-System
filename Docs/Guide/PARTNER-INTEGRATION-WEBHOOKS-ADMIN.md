# Partner integrations — Admin guide (API keys & webhooks)

**Audience:** JPS administrators with **Admin** page permission.

**Related:** Partner self-service contract — [INBOUND-SHIPPING-INSTRUCTION-PARTNER-API.md](./INBOUND-SHIPPING-INSTRUCTION-PARTNER-API.md) (v5.1).

---

## Where to open it

**Admin → Partner integrations** (`/admin/partner-api`).

Layout:

1. **Partners (left)** — select a registered integration key (EOS, KLIP, etc.).
2. **Credentials (right)** — masked key prefix, active/revoked, last used, **Revoke key**.
3. **Webhooks** — outbound URLs JPS POSTs to when plans are approved or milestones change.

Partners can register the same webhooks via **`POST /api/v1/integrations/webhooks`** with their **`x-api-key`**. Admin UI is for onboarding and support when the partner cannot call the API.

---

## Register a webhook (admin)

1. Select the partner key.
2. **Add webhook**.
3. Enter **HTTPS URL** (staging backend may allow HTTP when `INTEGRATION_WEBHOOK_ALLOW_HTTP=true` on the API host).
4. Choose events: **All events (`*`)**, **`status.changed`**, and/or **`schedule.updated`**.
5. Copy the **webhook secret** when shown — it is displayed **once** (HMAC verification on the partner side).

Limits: **3 active** endpoints per API key (same as partner API).

## Deliveries

Click **Deliveries** on a webhook row to inspect recent outbound attempts:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Delivery ID | Dedupe key (`X-JPS-Delivery-Id` on the partner request) |
| Event | `status.changed` or `schedule.updated` |
| Reference | Partner `external_reference` |
| Status | `pending`, `sent`, or `failed` |
| Payload | Expand to view JSON sent to the partner |

**Retry** re-queues a **failed** delivery for the in-process webhook worker.

---

## Document links (v5.1)

Partners may send HTTPS links on submit:

- `shipping_instruction_document_url`
- `contract_document_url`
- `bl_document_url`

JPS stores URLs on the shipping instruction; operators see **Partner document links** in the SI detail modal (read-only). JPS does not download or mirror partner files.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|--------|
| Deliveries stuck `pending` | API process running; webhook worker started in `Backend/src/index.js` |
| Repeated `failed` | Partner URL down, TLS issues, or non-2xx/timeout (>15s) |
| Invalid URL on create | Must be HTTPS in production; use staging HTTP flag only in non-prod |
| Partner locked out | Key revoked — create a new key and share plaintext once |

For signature verification and event shapes, point partners to **§3.4–3.6** of the partner API guide.
